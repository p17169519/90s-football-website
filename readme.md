# CTEC3905 Assignment

My website is based around football in England in the 1990's.
The site consists of 4 pages, index.html, kits.html, quiz.html and league.html

# References
The implementation of league.html and tableData.js was aided by the following code online

I adapted this code to produce a league table for the 92/93 premiership season.

The implementation of quiz.html and quiz.js was aided by the following YouTube Video:
